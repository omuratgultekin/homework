        "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Demo (TAKE_HOME_PROJECT)\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook implements a minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for a take-home project interview. The system answers user queries by leveraging content from two PDF datasets: `QuantumCore_Solutions_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v1.pdf` and `NeoCompute_Technologies_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v2.pdf`. It demonstrates versatility in handling varied queries (e.g., leadership roles, product lists, technical specifications) using a lightweight, CPU-friendly setup suitable for Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Combine retrieval and generative AI to provide accurate, context-grounded answers from PDF content.\n",
        "- **Resource Efficiency**: Use small models (`lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1` for embeddings, `google/flan-t5-base` for generation) to ensure compatibility with CPU environments.\n",
        "- **Post-Processing(moved to prompt)**: Apply minimal regex-based post-processing for role-based queries (e.g., extracting CEO names) and product queries (e.g., listing product names), with deduplication to ensure clean outputs.\n",
        "- **Interactivity**: Support an interactive query interface for demo purposes, with example queries to showcase functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "The pipeline follows a modular RAG design:\n",
        "- **Knowledge Base**: PDFs are loaded using `PyPDFLoader` and split into chunks (200 characters, 25-character overlap) with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Chunks are stored in a dictionary mapping document IDs to text, with source tracking for company-specific filtering.\n",
        "- **Semantic Layer**: Text chunks and queries are embedded into dense vectors using `lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1` for semantic similarity comparison.\n",
        "- **Retrieval System**: `retrieve.ColBERT` fetches the top 15 relevant chunks based on query embeddings, which are reranked to the top 3 using `rank.rerank` for improved relevance.\n",
        "- **Augmentation**: The top 3 chunks (up to 500 characters) are combined with combined with the query via a Few-Shot PromptTemplate tocreate a contextualized input for the generative model\n",
        "- **Generation**: `google/flan-t5-base` produces concise answers, with post-processing to extract names for role queries (e.g., CEO), list products for product queries, or deduplicate comma-separated lists.\n",
        "- **Fixes Implemented**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Added source tracking to filter chunks by company based on query keywords.\n",
        "  -  Implemented Few-Shot Prompting with fictional examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: Requires `pylate`, `langchain`, `transformers`, `google-colab`, `pypdf`, `hf_xet` for PDF processing, embedding, retrieval, and generation.\n",
        "- **Environment**: Designed for Google Colab with CPU, ensuring accessibility without GPU requirements.\n",
        "- **Datasets**: Processes `QuantumCore_Solutions_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v1.pdf` (quantum computing company details) and `NeoCompute_Technologies_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v3.pdf` (assumed similar content).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Instructions\n",
        "1. **Cell 1**: Install required Python libraries to set up the environment.\n",
        "2. **Cell 2**: Import libraries and suppress warnings for cleaner output.\n",
        "3. **Cell 3**: Define the RAG pipeline functions (`run_rag_pipeline` and `query_rag`) with improved logic.\n",
        "4. **Cell 4**: Load and process the PDFs, initializing the pipeline with models and indexes.\n",
        "5. **Cell 5**: Run an interactive query interface to test the pipeline with example or custom queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline combines chunks from both PDFs into a single knowledge base but filters by company when specified in queries, ensuring relevant responses."

The pipeline processes PDFs, embeds text chunks, retrieves relevant chunks, and generates answers using a Few-Shot prompt. It is optimized to run on CPU for accessibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "- Answer user queries about company details (e.g., leadership, products, specifications).\n",
        "- Support questions about QuantumCore, NeoCompute, or both, with source tracking.\n",
        "- Handle role-based, list-based, detail-based, and general questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "1. **PDF Processing**: Load and split PDFs into 300-character chunks.\n",
        "2. **Embedding & Indexing**: Use `lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1` to embed chunks and store in a `Voyager` index.\n",
        "3. **Retrieval & Reranking**: Retrieve top 15 chunks using `ColBERT`, rerank to top 3.\n",
        "4. **Generation**: Use `google/flan-t5-base` with a Few-Shot prompt to generate answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Updates\n",
        "- Optimized Few-Shot prompt to reduce token count.\n",
        "- Added input truncation to prevent token length errors.\n",
        "- Enhanced error handling for robustness.\n",
        "- Added token count logging for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "- Run cells sequentially.\n",
        "- Ensure PDFs are available in the working directory or uploaded via Colab.\n",
        "- Tested on Google Colab with CPU."
