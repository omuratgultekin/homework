        "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for a  take-home project interview.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system answers user queries based on two PDF datasets: `QuantumCore_Solutions_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v1.pdf` and `NeoCompute_Technologies_RAG_Demo_Dataset_v3.pdf`, showcasing versatility for varied queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "- Combine retrieval and generative AI to answer queries grounded in PDF content.\n",
        "- Use small, CPU-friendly models (`lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1`, `google/flan-t5-base`).\n",
        "- Minimize post-processing with regex for roles/products and deduplication.\n",
        "- Support interactive querying for demo purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "- **Knowledge Base**: PDFs are loaded (`PyPDFLoader`), split into chunks (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`), and stored in memory.\n",
        "- **Semantic Layer**: Chunks and queries are embedded using `lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1` for semantic comparison.\n",
        "- **Retrieval System**: `retrieve.ColBERT` fetches top 15 chunks, reranked to top 3 (`rank.rerank`).\n",
        "- **Augmentation**: Retrieved chunks (600-char limit) are combined with the query via `PromptTemplate`.\n",
        "- **Generation**: `google/flan-t5-base` generates answers, post-processed with regex and deduplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: `pylate`, `langchain`, `transformers`, `google.colab`, `pypdf`,`hf-text`.\n",
        "- **Environment**: Google Colab with CPU.\n",
        "- **Datasets**: PDFs in `/data` folder or uploaded manually.\n",

        "Run the cells below to set up and test the pipeline."
